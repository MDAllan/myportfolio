                    Iâ€™m the creative mind behind <strong>Mad Design Agency</strong>, where strategy meets aesthetics. 
                    My work blends design, development, and branding to craft engaging digital experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a passion for web development, branding, and UI/UX, I specialize in creating sleek and user-friendly websites, compelling visual identities, and interactive digital solutions.
                    <P>When I'm not designing, you'll find me exploring creativity in baking, painting, and interior design.
                    My artistic vision fuels my approach to digital and print media, ensuring that every project is meaningful, 
                    immersive, and visually striking.

                <h1>My Journey</h1>
             <p>
            Since I was young, Iâ€™ve always been immersed in art and design, participating in various art contests. A significant milestone in my early life was being honored as the <strong>Best Youth Artist</strong> in Lebanon in 2016, which gave me the confidence to pursue my creative passions further. </p>
            
            <p>
            After high school, I wanted to combine my technical skills with my creativity and explore new fields outside of what I studied. This led me to enroll in the Interactive Design - Website Design and Development program. It was the perfect fit to blend my love for design with the technical knowledge I sought.</P>

            <p>Today, Iâ€™m fortunate to work as the <strong>Branding Manager</strong> for Prince Tires, where I continue to grow professionally, expand my creative skills, and make meaningful impacts in branding and design. Iâ€™m passionate about working with clients, truly understanding their needs, and delivering tailored solutions that not only meet their expectations but exceed them. The challenge of translating their ideas into something visually stunning and functional is what drives me every day. </p>
